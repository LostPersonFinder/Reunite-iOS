# Reunite - iOS #

Reunite is a post-disaster family reunification tool. The app can be used for reporting and searching missing or found person information within those disaster events. The app uses a [People Locator](https://github.com/LostPersonFinder/people-locator) server as a data-store/backend.

This free app is primarily intended for by the general public to report missing and/or found people to the site. However, we encourage its use by emergency managers, disaster camp coordinators, disaster relief organizations, and medical aid and relief workers that are assisting in family reunification efforts after a disaster. The app includes on-device encryption of missing/found person records stored on the device. 

The Reunite app and People Locator apps are products of the Lost Person Finder project (now defunct) at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, which is an intramural R&D division of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
